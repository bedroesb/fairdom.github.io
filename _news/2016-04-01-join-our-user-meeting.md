We’re excited to announce the first combined user meeting for FAIRDOM. The meeting is for current users, and anyone interested in data and model management, or interested in using the FAIRDOM software and platforms (SEEK, FAIRDOMHub, openBIS, JWSOnline, RightField). It will be held as a satellite meeting of ICSB 2016, running on 15th September 2016 in Barcelona. 10am to 4pm. The best news is that the agenda, and coverage will be largely set by YOU!
At the meeting there will be keynotes, short presentations on real-case use of FAIRDOM software, flash presentations on ‘FAIRDOM in the wild’, and discussion forums where users can discuss the suite of FAIRDOM software.

At the meeting you will:
1. Learn how other research groups formulate their data and model management using FAIRDOM software.
2. Have direct contact with the FAIRDOM Community and Tech Team, who can give you personalised advice on your data and model management, and using FAIRDOM.
3. How users have extended the platforms to include e.g. electronic lab notebooks
4. Be an early audience for our ‘FAIRDOM for Publication’ extension.
