title: Register for FAIRDOM’s 2017 Webinar Series
---

After a hugely successful 2016 series, FAIRDOM will be launching its 2017 Webinar series on Thursday 19th January at 2pm GMT.

The webinar series will be of interest to students, researchers, project investigators, lab managers, institutions, publishers, data providers….anyone with data or models to manage.

Our first speaker will be Niall Beard representing ELIXIR-UK. 
He will be talking about “Building a training material portal: ELIXIR TeSS, BioSchemas and metadata scraping”. 

“For any discipline, identifying high quality training materials is difficult. 
They are often spread across different institutional websites, personal blogs, or stored in archives. 
This means you have to know exactly what you are looking for, and where to find it. 
However, for many, training occurs when the person knows little about the subject they wish to train in. 
This makes it difficult to know what material they need to look for. 
Once it is identified, it is also difficult to know what quality others within the community rate that material. 
To solve this problem for European Bioinformatics, we have generated the TeSS Portal. 
TeSS aggregates links to disparate training materials and events scattered around the institutional websites of ELIXIR Nodes and other content providers 
([GOBLET](http://mygoblet.org/training-portal), 
[Software and Data Carpentry](http://www.elixir-uk.org/elixir-uk-training-sectors/sectors/software-and-data-carpentry), 
[EBI TrainOnline](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/), 
[Genome3D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23203986), on-course, and more.), making them centrally discoverable and searchable. 
Training resources within TeSS can be collected and arranged into packages and/or training workflows, 
forming graphical representations of scientific pipelines in order to organise resources into easily navigable views. 
Aggregation of training content happens automatically through a set of custom-made nightly-run scraper scripts. 
Scrapers use a number of techniques to extract information: HTML-scraping and APIs had been the predominant methods, 
but are either temperamental or scarcely found respectively. More recently we have focused on parsing structured [schema.org](http://schema.org/) mark-up data. 
The TeSS team, through the Bioschemas group, have been heavily involved in developing schema.org specifications for Life science training resources and promoting their adoption”

Future speakers include

* 20th April, Veerle Van den Eynden (UK Data Archive, UK) and Gareth Knight (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Open Science attitudes and practices among Wellcome and ESRC funded researchers”
* 18th May, Carole Goble (University of Manchester, UK), “FAIRDOM”
* 15th June, Bjoern Gruening, “Conda and Containers for a sustainable bioinformatic infrastructure”.
* 20th July, MAtthew Pocock (Turing Ate My Hamster LTD), “ShortBOL: A shorthand for synthetic biology design”.
