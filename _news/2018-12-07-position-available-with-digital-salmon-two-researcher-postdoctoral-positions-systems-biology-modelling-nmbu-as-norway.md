Application deadline: Saturday 2018-12-15.

Email enquiries welcome: **Jon Olav Vik**, [jon.vik.@nmbu.no](mailto:jon.vik.@nmbu.no).  

The Norwegian University of Life Sciences has two vacant researcher or postdoc positions (up to two years) in systems biology of Atlantic salmon metabolism. 
These are part of the [Digital Salmon](https://www.nmbu.no/prosjekter/digisal), a transdisciplinary project using experimental omics data on metabolic reaction networks. Ideal for modellers seeking challenges and exposure to a world-class environment in integrative genetics and systems biology.

The Digital Salmon (2016-2020, 4 M€) is the national flagship project in digital production biology and part of the 
national consortium for biotechnology, [Digital Life Norway](https://digitallifenorway.org/gb/). 
Its objective is to establish a systems biology framework for adapting salmon breeding and nutrition strategies to modern feedstuffs. 
The long-term goal is to accumulate a library of various models of life processes in the salmon body, to quickly construct suit-tailored computer simulations to compute effective use of resources, for food security, fish welfare and human health. Such a knowledge base will enable faster response to challenges such as climate change, diseases, or scarcity of feedstuffs.

Main tasks:

* Develop and validate genome-scale and tissue-specific metabolic reconstructions for salmon

* Use these models to interpret multi-omics data from experiments on omega-3 metabolism under fish- vs plant-based feed, freshwater vs seawater, and more.

* Develop a test suite of metabolic function for automatic quality control, documentation and benchmarking of our models.
