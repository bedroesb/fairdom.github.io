title: SEEK version 1.9.1 released
---

We are pleased to announce a new version of [FAIRDOM SEEK](/platform/seek/) is now available, which is version 1.9.1

Along with a number of bug fixes this version includes

* Minor User Interface improvements
  * More consistent sorting of lists.
  * Consistent Add New button to add new items linked to the current item. This replaces buttons that only appeared in some places – such as the “Add New Data File” for “Assay”.
  * Split Edit and Manage actions between 2 separate pages, rather than being handled together through the same form.
* Initial support for bioschemas.org / schema.org JSON-LD markup – supporting Project, Taxon, Sample, Event, DataSet, DataCatalogue, DigitalDocument, and PresentationDigitalDocument
* Validating assay and technology type URI’s (particularly when submitting through the API).
* Managing project members through the API.
* Fix to an problem and inconsistency with how countries and the country codes are stored and displayed.
