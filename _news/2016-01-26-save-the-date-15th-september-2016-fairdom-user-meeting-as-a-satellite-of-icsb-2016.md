FAIRDOM will host a user meeting as a satellite meeting of [ICSB 2016](http://www.icsb2016barcelona.org/congress-information/general-information/) in  Barcelona on 15th September 2016. 
The user forum is for anyone who currently uses FAIRDOM software, or anyone who is interested in using FAIRDOM software, 
irrespective of seniority or scope of interest (students, researchers, lab managers, publishers, software developers etc).

The user meeting will feature talks from current users about how they use FAIRDOM software; talks about data management challenges users face in their current projects; discussions about data management; opportunities to speak with the FAIRDOM team about the software; and gain advice, tips, and expertise on defining your own data management strategies.

We will provide more information in the near future.
