title: SEEK version 1.10.0 released
---

We are pleased to announce a new version of [FAIRDOM SEEK](/platforms/seek) is now available, which is version 1.10.0

There have many minor improvements and bugfixes, but the main highlights include:

* Filtered search and browsing
* Enhanced support for publications
* Adding one or more Discussion Channel links to all Assets
* A _Request Contact_ button for Assets, to allow a registered user to initiate an email discussion with the owner and creators of that item.
* Increased zoom level when previewing model images, and ability to view the original in its full resolution
* Support for ‘include’ when using the JSON API
* Renaming of contributor to submitter – to be clearer about what this attribute represents
