Abstract: “Nowadays, most data produced in academic scientific laboratories is in electronic format, 
but experimental procedures are still often documented in paper laboratory notebooks. 
Linking the data to the procedures in this way is not straightforward and this often makes retrieval of relevant information in the mid and long term very problematic. 
Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are becoming increasingly popular in replacing paper laboratory notebooks. 
However, only the combination of an ELN with a data management platform and a laboratory information management system (LIMS), which is used to manage samples and standard operating procedures, allows users to keep track of the complete history of the work performed in the lab, from bench to publication. Keeping track of this history is a requirement for reproducibility of published results, which is fundamental for scientific progress. The open-source software openBIS ELN-LIMS combines these requirements in a single platform, which is specifically tailored to academic life science laboratories.” You can red more here: [http://fair-dom.org/knowledgehub/webinars-2/caterina-barillari/](/knowledgehub/webinars-2/caterina-barillari/)
