FAIRDOM will be attending the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Summit](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=events&eventcode=44D86060-FBA1-1BD1-9355822B162BB0EE) today, to help with generating a number of concrete statements related to how the EOSC should be implemented.

The event aims to:

* take stock of the progress made so far
* give stakeholders the opportunity to review the Commissionâ€™s vision for the European Open Science Cloud
* build consensus on the implementation plan and next steps

Carole Goble will be representing FAIRDOM, and our community. She will be speaking between 11:50 and 13:00 European Time, and you can catch a live stream of the whole event here:
