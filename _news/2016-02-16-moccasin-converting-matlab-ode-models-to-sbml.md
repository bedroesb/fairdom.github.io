title: MOCCASIN - converting MATLAB ODE models to SBML
---

Have you ever wanted to convert your MATLAB ODE model into an SBML model, without going through the hassle of manual conversion, or SBML construction in MATLAB? Great news, now you can!

Introducing MOCCASIN (Model ODE Converter for Creating Automated SBML INteroperability). 
MOCCASIN was developed by a transatlantic team of tech wizards, and published in BIOINFORMATICS this month. 
It uses Python, requires no access to MATLAB to run, and offers users command-line and graphical user interface options.
