Fantastic news and a great end to the year: we are now an Association e.V.!

Core members of the team met in Berlin on 12th December to establish the FAIRDOM Association e.V. as a legal entity.

Founding institutions include: [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/), 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](http://www.h-its.org/en/), and [New Forest Ventures Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10660154/?pathWildcard=10660154).

This means that interested parties are now able to join us as contributing members. We are still establishing the finer details of membership, but in the meantime, if you are interested in joining the FAIRDOM Association e.V you can speak with us directly to find out more (community@fair-dom.org).  

We were supported in the process by the expertise of [SB ScienceManagement](http://sb-sciencemanagement.com/).
