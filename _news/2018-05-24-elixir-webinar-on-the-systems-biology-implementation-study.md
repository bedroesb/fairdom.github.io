Representatives from ELIXIR France will present the outcomes from the Systems Biology Implementation Study to define the requirements for a European bioinformatics resource for microbial metabolism as well as providing a practical demonstration of how existing funded resources from ELIXIR partners could be integrated to meet those needs.

The webinar will take place on Wendesday 13 June 2018 at 14.00 BST (to be confirmed!).
