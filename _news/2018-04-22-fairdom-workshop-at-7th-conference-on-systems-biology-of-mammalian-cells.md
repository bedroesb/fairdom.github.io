title: FAIRDOM Workshop at 7th Conference on Systems Biology of Mammalian Cells
---

We will be hosting a workshop at the upcoming 7th Conference on Systems Biology of Mammalian Cells, 4th – 6th July, Bremen, Germany.

**LiSyM/de.NBI/ERASysAPP Tutorial: How to Share FAIR — The FAIRDOM Data and Model Management Practice**

**Martin Golebiewski & Wolfgang Mueller, HITS Heidelberg**

Participants will learn how to structure and share complex data in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) manner. 
Hands-on sessions, lectures and software demonstrations will provide attendees with the necessary skills to apply components of the 
FAIRDOM infrastructure in their daily work for interrelating and exchanging data, models and corresponding information.

FAIRDOM is a research infrastructure offering data management support. 
The SEEK software is designed as registry and storage place for data, models, biological samples, processes, publications and presentations, 
and at the same time as yellow pages for projects, people and events. 
SEEK is implemented as central data management platform in research networks such as LiSyM ([https://seek.lisym.org](https://seek.lisym.org)), 
but also as cross-project platform FAIRDOMhub ([https://www.fairdomhub.org](https://fairdomhub.org)) used e.g. by the European ERASysAPP initiative. The tutorial is jointly organized by LiSyM, ERASysAPP and the the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).
