title: New to FAIRDOMHub â€“ Create your own Programmes and Projects
---

Following the recent release and upgrade of [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/) to [SEEK version 1.0](/news/2015-12-17-seek-1-0-released/), 
we are pleased to announce that we now support creating and administering your own Programmes and Projects.

This means as a registered user you can create your own Programmes, and create and add your own Projects and Profiles and administer them. 
After creation the Programme will need to be approved by FAIRDOM, but afterwards it can be completely self-managed.

You can register with FAIRDOMHub at [https://fairdomhub.org/signup](https://fairdomhub.org/signup) if you do not already have an account.

Please visit our user guide for more details about this new service: [Creating and managing Programmes](http://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/programme-creation-and-management.html)

Once you have created a Programme, you will automatically become the Programme administrator. For more information about what you can then do, please read: [Programme administrator](http://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/roles.html#programme-administrator)
