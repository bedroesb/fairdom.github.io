title: SEEK version 1.9.0 released
---

The FAIRDOM team are pleased to announce a new version of SEEK – version 1.9.0

The highlights of this version includes:

* Major upgrade of the underlying platform
  * Rails 4.2 → Rails 5.2
  * Updating and replacing affected libraries and dependencies
  * Unifying javascript to use jQuery framework throughout, and removing Prototype references
  * Ability to login with email as well as username
  * Ability to edit previous version revision comments
  * Show the SEEK ID of the selected node when navigating the ISA overview
  * Fix for model files appearing missing for previous versions (don’t worry, no files were actually lost)
  * A lot of bugfixes and minor improvements discovered during the upgrade testing

The main bulk of this work was the upgrade to [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), the underlying platform SEEK is built upon, which included many changes. This work has been carried out in parallel to other work over several months, and undergone a lot of testing. Bringing things up to date ensures we continue to get feature enhancements, improvements and security fixes.

Details on installing SEEK can be found in our Documentation, at [https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html](https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html) – including running with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
