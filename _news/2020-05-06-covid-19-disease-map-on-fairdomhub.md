title: COVID-19 Disease Map on FAIRDOMHub
---

FAIRDOM helps to collect knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 
and established a project in FAIRDOMHub for the **COVID-19 Disease Map**: [https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190](https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190).

he COVID-19 Disease Map is an assembly of molecular interaction diagrams established based on literature evidence for virus-host 
interaction mechanisms specific to the SARS-CoV-2. In the project lists of contributors, 
data and computational models, and literature is shared.

FAIRDOMHub and the data management support for the COVID-19 disease map 
gets featured in Nature Scientific Data [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0477-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0477-8).
