Frederik Coppens of VIB invited institutional data managers from the Belgian Flanders region, as well as FAIRDOM team and users to Ghent in order to discuss FAIRDOM data management and possible future collaboration.

The workshop started out with a presentation session in which the participating institutions presented their planned use case scenarios.

Katy Wolstencroft from Uni Leiden presented the early history of FAIRDOM, the use cases that shaped FAIRDOM and SEEK.  After a discussion of the need of the visiting institution, Fatemeh Zamanzad Ghavidel from Bergen (Digital Life, ELIXIR Norway) presented their use of FAIRDOM together with NeLS, the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for the Life Sciences. Then Wolfgang Müller of FAIRDOM/LiSyM/de.NBI described a variety of use cases for FAIRDOM in projects.

Then, Stuart Owen presented the FAIRDOM solution for a concrete scenario provided by Frederik Coppens. This scenario involved running Galaxy from within FAIRDOM, the use of sample types in SEEK, as well as the extraction of metadata. Wolfgang Müller presented Jupyter Notebooks running from within SEEK, as well as the use of openRefine for creating bespoke data transformation solutions.

The day finished with breakout discussions about a variety of topics from development to community management.

On the second day, pathways to collaboration were discussed in more depth.
