The CORBEL Open Call invites researchers to apply to access technologies and services from more than 20 facilities from 10 different research infrastructures across Europe. Selected projects will gain unprecedented opportunities to utilise a wide range of high-end technologies and services. 
These include state-of-the-art offers from the fields of advanced imaging, biobanking, clinical and translational research, 
curated databases, marine model organisms, mouse mutant phenotyping, high-throughput screening, structural biology as well as systems biology.

Costs for travel to partner sites will be reimbursed by CORBEL and access to service providers will be granted without access fee 
(extra costs for consumables may apply). Projects will be supported at every stage, 
with CORBEL project managers at hand to help scientists navigate between different service providers and exploit the full potential of the offers 
available. Learn more about the CORBEL Open Call by visiting our website ([http://www.corbel-project.eu/open-call.html](http://www.corbel-project.eu/open-call.html)).

CORBEL – Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science services – is an EC Horizon2020 project uniting 13 Biological and Medical Science Research Infrastructures (RIs). In CORBEL, the participating RIs expand their cooperation in order to harmonise researchers’ access to their cutting-edge technologies and services by establishing a sustainable platform of aligned services that will enable faster admission to a wider portfolio of technologies and services to boost research projects.
