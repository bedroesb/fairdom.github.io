title: Multi-Scale Biology Study Group, 12th-15th December 2017
---

The University of Birmingham, with funding from the UK [Multi-Scale Biology Network](http://www.multiscalebiology.org.uk/), will host a Multi-Scale Biology Study Group from 12th-15th December 2017. This event will bring together biologists, clinicians and scientists in industry with mathematicians to tackle research questions posed by the experimentalists, following the successful [Multi-Scale Biology Study Group](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/D.Smith/StudyGroup.htm) held in 2016.

Registration is free for up to 20 non-local UK-based researchers and will cover accommodation and subsistence. Places will be filled on a first-come first-served basis when registration opens shortly. Further details will be [posted](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/D.Smith/StudyGroup2017.htm) as they become available, any queries should be directed to [d.j.smith.2@bham.ac.uk](mailto:d.j.smith.2@bham.ac.uk) or [r.j.dyson@bham.ac.uk](mailto:r.j.dyson@bham.ac.uk). Interested mathematics researchers at all levels are encouraged to attend.

The call for problems will shortly go out â€“ if you know of an experimental researcher who may be interested please ask them to contact Dave Smith (d.j.smith.2@bham.ac.uk) or Rosemary Dyson (r.j.dyson@bham.ac.uk).
