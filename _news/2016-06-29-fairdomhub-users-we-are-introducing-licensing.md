title: FAIRDOMHub users - we are introducing licensing
---

The new SEEK 1.1. release, allows users/creators to define the license under which to openly share their research data – which includes Datafiles, Models, SOPs, and Presentations.

What is the use of this? According to current copyright law and jurisdiction, any artefact without a defined license has all rights reserved. 
However, most people sharing
data want to be more permissive, and enable easier and safer reuse along with proper credit and attribution.

For data, the most common licenses are the Creative Commons licenses, 
and in most cases we suggest using the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license ([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) ). 
This is the default license applied to new data added to the FAIRDOMHub, but creators of data/assets can change licensing type at their own discretion.

You can find more information about all the licenses available, along with a short video about the benefits of licensing open data at [http://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/licenses.html](http://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/licenses.html)

IMPORTANT: Existing data on the FAIRDOMHub have been tied to “no license, all rights reserved” – which is the equivalent to what they were before this change.

If you wish us to apply a bulk change to apply a given license to all the data across your project, we can do this for you. Please contact us at support@fair-dom.org with information your project and the license you would wish us to apply.
